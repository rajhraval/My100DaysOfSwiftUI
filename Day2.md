## Day 2 - HackingWithSwift - 100DaysOfSwiftUI Challenge

> When going gets tough, everyone leaves - Lynch's Law

### Complex Data Types
Today I learnt about:

- Arrays
- Sets
- Tuples
- Arrays v/s Sets v/s Tuples
- Dictionaries and its default values
- Enumerations
- Enum raw and associated values

The Summary of the entire day was:

- Arrays, sets, tuples, and dictionaries let you store a group of items under a single value. They each do this in different ways, so which you use depends on the behavior you want.
- Arrays store items in the order you add them, and you access them using numerical positions.
- Sets store items without any order, so you can’t access them using numerical positions.
- Tuples are fixed in size, and you can attach names to each of their items. You can read items using numerical positions or using your names.
- Dictionaries store items according to a key, and you can read items using those keys.
- Enums are a way of grouping related values so you can use them without spelling mistakes.
- You can attach raw values to enums so they can be created from integers or strings, or you can add associated values to store additional information about each case.

**That's All for the Day 2 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI!**
